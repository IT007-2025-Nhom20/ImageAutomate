POST-INSTALLATION INFORMATION
Project: ImageAutomate

1. INSTALLATION COMPLETE

The application has been successfully installed on your system. You may now
launch ImageAutomate via the Desktop shortcut or the Start Menu entry.

2. GETTING STARTED

ImageAutomate is a modular, node-based image processing framework designed
to build execution pipelines.

3. BASIC USAGE:

3.1. Open an existing graph or create a new one.
3.2. Drag nodes (I/O, Transform, Effects, etc.) from the left sidebar onto
the canvas.
3.3. Drag from an output socket to an input socket to link nodes.

4. CRITICAL RULES:

- The graph must contain at least one "LoadBlock".
- The graph must contain at least one "SourceBlock".
- All inputs must be connected.
- The graph must be acyclic (no infinite loops).

5. EXTENSIBILITY (PLUGINS)

ImageAutomate supports custom blocks via plugins.

TO ADD NEW BLOCKS:

1. Create a Class Library referencing "ImageAutomate.Core".
2. Implement the "IBlock" interface.
3. Place the compiled DLL into the application directory.

6. TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

If the application fails to start:

A. Missing Runtime (.NET 9.0):
This application requires the .NET 9.0 Desktop Runtime. If not
installed automatically, please download it from the Microsoft website.

B. Permission Denied:

7. UNINSTALLATION
